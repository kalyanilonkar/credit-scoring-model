A machine learning pipeline for predicting the probability of default on unsecured loan applications.  
Developed as part of the MSc Data Analytics for Business Decision Making (BMAN60422) at the University of Manchester.

---

##  Project Overview
-  **Data:** 5,960 historical loan applications
-  **Goal:** Predict likelihood of default to help banks balance growth & risk
-  **Scenarios:**
  - **Goal 1:** Maximize approvals while catching â‰¥85% of defaulters
  - **Goal 2:** Be highly risk-averse (â‰¥70% specificity), capturing most defaulters
  - **No goal:** Balanced growth, interpretable decisions

-  Structured under **CRISP-DM framework**
-  Interpretability via **SHAP** & SAS Decision Tree

---

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python EDA.py
python modeling.py
```
- Ensure `imputed_data.xlsx` is in the same folder.

## ðŸ”¬ Models & Techniques
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, HGBT, SVC, KNN, MLP, Decision Tree
- Stratified train-test splits (75:25), 10-fold cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning & threshold adjustments
- SHAP values for interpretability
- Business-oriented metrics: Sensitivity, Specificity, PR-AUC

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Recommendations
- **Selective growth:** HGBT, balancing approvals with high quality
- **Highly risk-averse:** RF, catching nearly all defaulters, conservative
- **Balanced:** DT, interpretable decisions for compliance (GDPR/FCA)
